My friends work at night. Sometimes they don't want to eat, but they always drink water. If the cook arrives early, then everyone is happy because they can rest. I ask who is singing, and my dog runs to the door.

Sani todoci mio ni guoka ne noite. Nani daite, sani le no ni guane ni kome; ma, masa cika, sani le ni kome ke guare. Fi, kome ni kini cikae; so, sani le copi; bo, sani le ni pomo ni mate. Mi ni kati pa ke kosa ka keca ni kuta li ko; ta, kanao mio ni kore ki getera.
