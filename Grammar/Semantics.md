## Booleans

- `si`: Positive, true, yes
- `no`: Negative, false, no

## Personification
You can't say directly `Mi sa biba` because that literally means `I am life`, and that probably wasn't your intention. That's why we need the personification noun modifier `kano`.

`kano` convert any compound noun or simple noun into a personification of it, for example: 
- `biba kano` -> "The one who live" or "alive"
- `kome kano` -> "The one who eat" or "eater"
- `toki kano` -> "The one who talk" or "speaker"

So, if you want to say "I'm alive", you should say: `Mi sa biba kano`.
