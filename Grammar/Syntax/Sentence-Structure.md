# Sentences structure 
---
All sentences follow the structure of **SVO**, but a more accurate may looks like: 

```
Linker, Context position, Subject, Verb, Adverb, Direct Object, Indirect Object
```
---
## Linker
Linker are prepositions (visit the prepositions page for more information). 

---
## Context position
Nouns, adverbs and adjectives to locate where the action is occurring, this can refer in time or position contexts: 
> "**daifore**, Mi ni kone fu to kasaca" -> "**Tomorrow**, I will return home"
 
 Also you can establish frequency in where the action is done: 
 > "**nani daite**, Mi ni kore ne daitese" -> "**Some days**, I run in the morning"

---
## Subject 
Subjects are nouns and must be capitalized 
> "**Tu** no ni kore" -> "**You** don't run"
> "daitese, **Kanao** mio ni kome pa na" -> "My **dog** was eating this morning"

Subjects can have adjectives and prepositions, but always have to be first
> "nani cika, **kibodo** regosa biga mia ni nese ke fosu" 
> "My red big **keyboard** need a fix some times"

---
## Verb
Each sentence must have a verbal form. The verbal form must match with the time context. For more information about the verb read [[Verbs]].

---
## Object
Depending on the verb valency are the objects on the sentence. You can omit verb object, but you can not add to it.

Using "ni gona" (to go) as an example. This is a binary destination verb so it requires a destination but you can omit it: 

> "Mi ni gona"-> "I go". Grammatically correct. Even if you skip the destination object, it is not required to put it. 

In the opposite case, using "ni sapa" (to sleep). This is a unitary verb so it doesn't expect any object:

>"Mi ni sapa to kasaca" -> "I sleep to house". Grammatically incorrect because "ni sapa" doesn't expect any object. 

---
## Relative clauses 
Relative clause must be enclose with "ko". "ko" indicates the end of a sentence. Normally it is omitted but in some cases you will need it to eliminate ambiguity: 

> "Mi ni mobe pa **ke kanao (ni kome pa ke patao ko)** to citotara" 
> "I moved the **dog (that ate the duck)** to somewhere else"

Also "ko" is used when you want to link sentence using a "or" relationship: 

> "Tu ka kome pa ke patao ko?; ro, Kanao tua ka kome pa ke patao?"
> "Did you ate the duck or the dog ate the duck ?"

"Ko" is used here to correctly indicate that the sentence ends, this avoid confusion in whether "ro" is used in the object or as a conjunction.

---
## Adjectives
Adjectives are nouns placed next to other noun, only the first noun is the real noun, everything after that is a adjective: 

>"**Karato** *bogala biga*" -> "*Blue big* **car**"


You can use adjectives to describe the action in a sentence: 

> "mi ni kore sofore to kasaca" -> "I run fast to the house"

To use it in this case, you have to put the noun next to the verbal form to transform it into an adverb.

---
## Preposition

Prepositions are short ways of making sentences without modifying the main sentence: 

> "Kanao du mama ni kome na ne kasaca ke kome ra kanao" 
> 
> "Mom's dog eats in the house the dog's food"
>
> - kanao -> dog
> - du mi -> possessed by mom, mom's
> - ni kome na -> to eat in imperfect form, eating 
> - ne kasaca -> in the house 
> - ke kome -> object: food
> - ra kanao -> for the dog

Notice that you can put prepositions to describe also the action in the sentence. The preposition should be next to the verbal from.

You can link prepositions to create more complex expresions: 

> "kanao ne kasaca du papa" -> "the dog in the dad's house"

But the preposition will always describe the noun right after it, so if you want to give another description to the main noun or verb, you should use "da" to separate different chains of prepositions: 

> "kanao ne kasaca da du papa" -> "Dad's dog in the house"
