# Sentences structure 
---
All sentences follow the structure of **SVO**, but a more accurate may looks like: 

```
Linker, Context position, Subject, Verb, Direct Object, Indirect Object
```
---
## Linker
Linker are conjunctions (visit the conjunctions page for more information). Its function is to connect the current sentence to the last one. 

---
## Context position
This is any nouns, adverbs and adjectives to locate where the action is occurring, this can refer in time, position or context: 
> "**gu daifore**, Mi ni kone fu to kasaca" -> "**Tomorrow**, I will return home"
 
Also you can establish frequency in where the action is done: 
 > "**nani daite**, Mi ni kore ne daitese" -> "**Some days**, I run in the morning"

Place: 
> "**ne kasaca** du nisa, Kanao ni kore" -> "In brother's house, the dog runs"

When establishing time context at the beginning of a sentence, you can omit any context preposition particle (be, gu, ne, etc) if it is obvious that the preposition body is referring to time context. If this preposition create ambiguity with the subject, you can use the subject particle "la" to eliminate this ambiguity:
>"ne kasaca, roasa ni leuso" -> "In the red house  lacks" ❌ 

>"ne kasaca, **la** roasa ni leuso" -> "In the house, the red lacks" ✅

Even with the comma separating both nouns, the listening of the phrase could turn ambuiguous.

## Subject 
Subjects are nouns and must be capitalized: 
> "**Tu** no ni kore" -> "**You** don't run"
> "daitese, **Kanao** mio ni kome pa na" -> "My **dog** was eating this morning"

Subjects can have adjectives and prepositions, but always have to be first:
> "nani cika, **Kibodo** regosa biga mia ni nese ke fosu" 
> "My red big **keyboard** need a fix some times"

There is also a subject marker "la", but this particle is only used when the subject is not at the beginning of the sentence and something is creating ambiguity: 
> "meiso fore, **la** Nisa mia ni gone to kasaca du nimana" 
> "Next month, my sibling will go to aunt house mia"

In this case, the noun "nisa" could be confused with an adjective of "month". Using the subject particle, you eliminate this ambiguity. 

---
## Verb
Verbs are marked with the mood particles. This could be: 
- "go": imperative 
- "ni": for indicative
- "ka": for yes or not questions

Most of the cases you gonna see "ni": 
> "Mi ni kore" -> "I run"

Verbs also define grammatical tense using the particles:
- "pa": past
- "fu": future
- present if not presented

This is in case tense is not obvious. Some cases, the speaker can just use the context position and omit the tense: 
> "Mi ni kome pa" -> I ate 

> "daifore, Mi ni kome" -> "Yesterday, I eat" or "I ate yesterday"

## Object
Depending on the verb valency, the sentence will have direct object, indirect object, both, or neither. Toki Kasa separate the verbs into four categories of valency: 

- Unitary: the verb doesn't receive any object:
> "Mi ni *sapa*" -> "I sleep"

- Binary patient: the verb can receive direct object: 
> "Mi ni *kome* **ke** patao" -> "I eat duck"

- Binary destination: the verb can receive indirect object: 
> "Mi ni *gone* **to** kasaca" -> "I go home" 

- Ternary: the verb can receive both direct or indirect objects:
> "mi ni *gabe* **ke** kome **to** kanao" -> "I give food to the dog"

## Relative clauses 
Relative clause are sentences inside of the sentences. This can be placed in the subject, object or preposition body but they must be enclose with "ko". "ko" indicates the end of a sentence. Normally it is omitted but in some cases you will need it to eliminate ambiguity: 

> "Mi ni mobe pa **ke kanao (ni kome pa ke patao ko)** to cito tara"
> "I moved the **dog (that ate the duck)** to somewhere else"

I don't encourage to use relative clause as this increase complexity in the sentences. This is an option for flexibility but it is more recommended to separate topics in sentences.

## Questions
In Toki Kasa exist the interrogative particle "ka". Depending on where you place it, will be the kind of question it will be: 
##### "Yes" or "not" questions:
If the "ka" particle is replacing the "ni" verbal particle, it convert the sentence into a yes or not question: 
> - "Tu ka kome pa? " -> "Did you eat?"
> - "si" -> "yes"

The only options to reply to this questions are "si" or "no" ("yes" or "not"). 
##### Complete sentences questions: 
If the "ka" particle is replacing the body of any of the object, or verbal preposition, or it is right before the verbal form, it would be asking for a complete sentence: 
###### How? 
When you want to ask on how the action occurred, the "ka" particle must be right after the verb. This represent the idea that "ka" substitute the adjectives after the verb, so the listener should reply with this adjective.
- Q:  Tu ni kore ka ? -> How do you run ? 
- A: Mi ni kore sofare -> I run quickly 
###### What or to who ?
You can query both direct and indirect object: 
- Q: Tu ni gabe pa ke ka ? -> What did you give ?
- A: ke boki -> A bottle  
###### Using prepositions  
You can query for any preposition body too: 
- Q: Tu ni gone de ka ? -> where you came from ?
- A: de kasaca mia -> from my house

You can do this for any preposition. This way of querying information only work for verbal prepositions, the one that affect the whole sentence. Because of that, you can put it at any position of the sentence only while it doesn't create ambiguity: 
- Q: be ka, tu ni gone to kasaca ? -> when are you going home?
- A: be doe roira -> After two hours
