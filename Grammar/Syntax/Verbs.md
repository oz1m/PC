# Verbs

## Mood
Each noun can be turned into a verb using the mood specifier as verb marker. The language have three mood specifier: 
- **ni**: indicative 
- **ka**: interrogative 
- **go**: imperative 

Using "kome" (consumable) you can form the verb "to consume" also used as "to eat": 
- "Mi **ni kome**" -> "I eat"
- "Tu **ka kome**?" -> "do you eat ?"
- "Tu **go kome**" -> "eat" as a order
---
## Tense 
There are 3 tenses: 
- omitted: present
- **fu**: future 
- **pa**: past 

The tense is a marker that you put next to the verb noun: 
- "Mi ni kome **pa**" -> "I eat in the past" - "I ate"
- "Mi ni kome **fu**" -> "I eat in the future" - "I will eat"
---
## Aspects
There are 4 aspects: 
- omitted: perfective 
- **na**: imperfective 

The aspect marker must be placed after the tense marker: 
- "Mi ni kome **na**" -> "Im eating"
- "Mi ni kome fu **na**" -> "I will be eating"
- "Mi ni kome pa **na**" -> "I was eating"

## Valency
All verbs expect subject as argument (there is no impersonal verbs). Verbs are divided in 3 type: 
### Unitary
 Expect only the subject:
- "**Mi** ni sapa" -> "**I** sleep"
- "**le** ni guoka" -> "**She/He** work"
### Binary patient
 Expect subject and direct object (patient), the thing that is being affected by the action. You have to use the direct object marker "ke" to indicate the object:
- "**Mi** ni kome **ke patao**" -> "**I** eat **duck**"
### Binary destination
Expect subject and indirect object (destination), the goal. You have to use the indirect object marker "li" to indicate the object:
- "**Mi** ni gona **li kasaca**" -> "**I** go **to house**"
### Ternary
Expect subject and both direct and indirect object. You may use both object markers to indicate each object: 
- "**Mi** ni dona **ke kanao** ***li tu***" -> "**I** give **the dog** ***to you***"

Some languages use a particle to indicate the indirect object like the "to" marker in English but don't indicate direct object.

## Auxiliarly verbs 
You can link verbs together to modify mood: 
- "mi **ni guane ni kome**" -> "I **want to eat**"
- "tu **ni nese ni gona**" -> "You **need to go**"

### Voice modifier
Normal verbs modify the mood, but there are two special verbs just used to modify the voice: 
- **ni keca**: Passive indirect object 
- **ni lica**: Passive direct object 

Examples: 
- "patao **ni keca** ni kome pa bi mi" -> "The duck was eaten by me"
- "kasaca **ni lica** ni gona pa bi mi" -> this doesn't have a literal translation in English but it should be something like "The house was go by me"
