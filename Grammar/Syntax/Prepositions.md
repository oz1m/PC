# Prepositions
---
Prepositions are a key part of the Toki kasa language. Sentences tend to be verbose when getting complexity, prepositions are ways to create short sentences inside of the sentences describing parts of it: 

> "Kanao ***du* tu** ni kore na to sareta ***fo* kasaca** ***du* mi**" -> "Your dog is running to the street in front of my house"

Here you can see that prepositions are used specifically to link two nouns to describe the first one, but they can also modify the verbal form:

> "Mi ni gone na ***ge* karato** to kasaca" -> "I'm going home using the car" or "I'm going to my house in car"

When used on verbs, this preposition describe the whole sentence instead of just subject, direct object or indirect object.

### Dynamic sentences prepositions
When modifying the entire sentence with prepositions of the verb, they do not need to be exactly next to the verb. They are expected to be next to it, but this is optional, and they can also be in other positions in the sentence as long as they do not conflict with other parts or introduce ambiguity into the sentence.

> "***de* kasaca**, la Kanao ni gone to sareta" -> "from the house, the dog go to the street"

Notice that in this case, due to the ambiguity introduced by the preposition, I had to use subject specifier.

### Chaining prepositions
You can put prepositions over prepositions, this is called "chaining prepositions": 

> "kasaca du nisa du mi" -> "House of brother of me" or "My brother's house"

Prepositions only affect the noun right behind it; so, in this last example, the "du mi" is describing "nisa", not "kasaca". 

If you want to add other preposition to the main noun "kasaca", you need to use "da". This particle reset the chain of prepositions: 

- "kasaca du nisa du mi ci raki" -> In this case, "ci raki" refer to "mi". This doesn't make any sense
- "kasaca du nisa du mi **da** ci raki" -> The chain of preposition reset, that's why "ci raki" refer to kasaca now

Think on "da" as a connector with the main noun, everything you put after it, will affect the noun. This means that when you use adjectives on "da", this adjectives are also affecting the main noun: 

> "kasaca rogosa du mi ***da* biga ci monata**" -> "My red big house next to the mountain"

---
### Nominal sentences 
A nominal sentence is a sentence without infinitive verb form. This means that even if you don't see the "ni" verb particle, there is a sentence. This can be form using the main nouns as subject, and adjectives and prepositions as predicate:  

> "Kasaca neroto du mi da fo monata" -> "My black house in front of the mountain"

You should interpret nominal sentences as grammatically true in all its parts, the speaker is affirming that information. Then, use the imperfect form of "to be" as the implicit verb: 

- "Kasaca ni sate na ke neroto" -> the house is black
- "Kasaca ni sate na ke du mi" -> the house is mine  
- "Kasaca ni sate na ke fu monata" -> the house is in front of a montain

### Interrogation
Interrogation in Toki kasa is very exact. Using the prepositions and the "ka" interrogative particle, you create interrogative capsules. Then, using the same prepositions, you reply: 

> "ga ka, Tu ni gone pa to kasaca" -> "With who you went to the house" or "You went to the house with who ?"

and then you can reply:  

> "ga nisa" -> "With brother"

Basically, the speaker create a blank space and the listener have to fill the blank.

---
### Relative clauses
You can include relative clauses in prepositions: 

> "ganaci fa ni case ke loba" -> "story about chasing the love"

To avoid ambiguity, relative clauses in prepositions must be enclosed with the "ko" particle. This is only in case relative clause could cause ambiguity.

I don't encourage using relative clauses. They are a option, but they also create complexity to the sentence. Use it in case you need it, but preferably choose to separate the sentences.

### List 
#### Agent
- **bi**: A is made by B. B did A. This can be used with voice modifiers verbs ("ni lica", "ni keca") to complete the sentence: 
> "'Don Quixote' **bi** Miguel de Cervantes ni sate ke boki" -> "'Don Quixote' by Miguel de Cervantes is a book"
> "Patao ni keca ni kome **bi** kanao du tu" -> "The duck was eaten by your dog"

- **ge**: A is using/wearing B:
> "Kano **ge** neroto ni tara" -> "The man in black looks weird"
> "Mi ni gone na **ge** karato to kasaca" -> "I'm going home in car" 

- **te**: A is being used by B. B uses A: 
> "Kenuci **te** koputa ni lauka na" -> "Computer energy is running out"

#### Position
This prepositions can refer to a relative position in space, time, or context. All of this means basically the same, the only thing that change is the position: 
- **ne**: A in the position of B
- **nu**: A inside B
- **su**: A outside B
- **ru**: A above B 
- **re**: A below B
- **ba**: A back B 
- **fo**: A in front B
- **ci**: A next to/around B
- **geo**: A at the end of B
- **tea**: A at the beginning of B

> "Mi ne kasaca" -> "I am in the house"

I'm not giving examples for every preposition because you can substitute each one and the only thing that will change is the position.
#### Direction
This ones are very useful when creating nominal sentences about the movement of a subject:
- **ki**: A goes toward B 
> "Mi ki sakola" -> I'm going to school

- **de**: A originates from B:
> "kareto de sareta" -> "The car is coming from the street"

- **mu**: A moves through/across B:
> "tareo mu motana" -> "The train cross the mountain"
#### Composition 
- **ra**: A for/because B. The reason of A is B 
> "kome ra kanao" -> "food for dogs" or "dog's food"

- **do**: A is part of B / A is made of B / B is composed of A:
> "kasaca do renaga" -> "house of bricks"

- **du**: A is possessed by B / B have A 
> "cae buki du mi" -> "that book is mine"

- **ga**:  A is with B 
> "Mi ga tu" -> "Me with you" or "Me and you"

- **su**: A possesses B
> "Kano su tei kasaca" -> "The owner of this house"

- **fa**: A is about B 
> "Buki fa maigo"

- **sa**: A taking the role of B 
> "Mi sa nisa" -> "Me as borther"

- **se**: A is like/similar to B
> "rougo du tu da se rougo du mi" -> "Your coat is similar to mine"
#### Cause and effect/Time relations
- **ku**: A is as long as B in time context. B define the duration of A 
> "beto ku noe guise" -> "the event one week long"

- **be**: A after B in time context 
> "tese do sakola da be doe guise" -> "start of school after next week"

- **gu**: A when/in/start at B in time context
> "naise du mi da gu daifore" -> "My birthay is tomorrow"

The main difference between "be" and "gu" is that "be" expect a time amount, and "B" expect a time position.
