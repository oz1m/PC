## Number 
Normally, nouns that end with "s" will refer and a more than one amount of that thing: 

- `nisa` -> sibling | `nisas` -> "siblings" 


## Suffix
### `sa`
The "sa" suffix comes from the "kosa" word. It basically convert its root into the thing that the root holds: 

- `boru` -> mind | `borusa` -> though

This is pretty subjective, but it help linking word with a possesion relationship.

## `lesu`
Similar to the english "less" it indicates a  lack of the root:

- `boru` -> mind | `borulesu` -> brainless, dumb
- `nisa` -> sibling | `nisalesu` -> only child
