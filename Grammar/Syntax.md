## Verbs

### Mood
In PC the verb itself doesn't exist. That's why we use a mood specifier before a noun to indicate that the verb form of that noun is being used. 

- `ni`: The speaker is affirming an information.
- `ka`: The speaker is asking for information.
- `go`: The speaker is giving a command; imperative.

If you use `ni` and omit the pronoun, first person is assumed: 
- `Ni kome na` -> "I'm eating"

If you use `ka` or `go` and omit the subject, second person is assumed: 
- `Ka se` -> "Who are you?"
- `Go kiki` -> "Go" (Imperative)

### Negation
Use the boolean particles before the mood specifier to negate/affirm the action. 

### Tense
The action is taking place in:
- `fu`: Future
- `pa`: Past
- Present is represented by the absence of any of the modifiers above.
### Mood 
The particle "na" indicates that the action is being made and haven't finished (Imperfect). Don't specify "na" to indicate perfect.

### Examples
- `Mi ni kome pa` -> "I ate"
- `Le ka toki ` -> "Does he talk ?"
- `Tu go loki` -> "Look!" (in imperative mode)
- `Ka siu pa na` -> "how have you been?"

## Personification
You can't say directly `Mi sa biba` because that literally means `I am life`, and that probably wasn't your intention. That's why we need the personification noun modifier `kano`.

`kano` convert any compound noun or simple noun into a personification of it, for example: 
- `biba kano` -> "The one who live" or "alive"
- `kome kano` -> "The one who eat" or "eater"
- `toki kano` -> "The one who talk" or "speaker"

So, if you want to say "I'm alive", you should say: `Mi sa biba kano`.
