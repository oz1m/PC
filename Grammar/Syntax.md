## Verbs

### Mood
In PC the verb itself doesn't exist. That's why we use a mood specifier before a noun to indicate that the verb form of that noun is being used. 

- `ni`: The speaker is affirming an information.
- `ka`: The speaker is asking for information.
- `go`: The speaker is giving a command; imperative.

If you use `ni` and omit the pronoun, first person is assumed: 
- `Ni kome na` -> "I'm eating"

If you use `ka` or `go` and omit the subject, second person is assumed: 
- `Ka se` -> "Who are you?"
- `Go kiki` -> "Go" (Imperative)

### Negation
Use the boolean particles before the mood specifier to negate/affirm the action. 

### Tense
The action is taking place in:
- `fu`: Future
- `pa`: Past
- Present is represented by the absence of any of the modifiers above.
### Mood 
The particle "na" indicates that the action is being made and haven't finished (Imperfect). Don't specify "na" to indicate perfect.

### Examples
- `Mi ni kome pa` -> "I ate"
- `Le ka toki ` -> "Does he talk ?"
- `Tu go loki` -> "Look!" (in imperative mode)
- `Ka siu pa na` -> "how have you been?"

## Conjunctions
We have 4 sentences linkers: 

- `so`: causal forward link | cause -> effect 
- `ma`: contrastive adversative, opposition between both sentences
- `ta`: sequential temporal link | first A happen, then B
- `ko`: causal backward link | effect -> cause

You can use any of then to convert two sentences into compound sentences, using the corresponding linker for each occasion:

 - "Mi ni teno li katae; **so**, mi ni katae fu" -> "I have a question **so** I will ask"
- "Mi ni seno pa li le; **ma**, mi no ni like pa li le" -> "I meet him, **but** i didn't like him"
- "Mi ni ruku pa; **ta**, mi ni sata li kore" -> "I was walking, **then** i start running"
- "mi ni like li kanis; **ko**, les ni se li kuta" -> "I like dogs because they are cute"

#### If-statements
We also have a particle `fi`. You put this at the very beginning of your sentence and it would turn it into a probably cause. Then you can use the `so`, so if the cause occurs, so will trigger the effect: 

- "**fi** kacoro du mi ni kore; **so** mi ni kore" -> "If my dog runs, i run"

#### Anonymous cause  
The way that `so` work is that it connect two sentences A and B, where A is the cause of B. 

 - "ri cuse raine; **so**, mi ni geta li paragua"

Anonymous cause allow you to avoid the A sentence, so you will only have "so, B".

- "**So**, mi ni geta li paragua"

This doesn't change the meaning of the sentance. It is a effect, just that the cause is not specify. 

This is useful in two scenarios:
#####  Probable sentences
As we already state in the if statement, the particle "fi" convert a cause into a probable cause, so you will have actions that may or may not occurs: 

- "**fi**, tu ni kone...." 

then if you use **so** to link another sentence, the effect of so will turn into a probable effect because it depends on a probable cause. 

But now we now that the effect of so can be omitted, so you can have this kind of sentences:

- "**Fi so**, mi ni kome"

`Fi` convert a omitted (or anonymous) cause into a probable cause, and `so`, getting the probable cause, convert a sentence into a probable effect. This would translate the sentence into something like: "I would eat" or "I may eat", where the "may" and "would" express possibility.

##### Dynamic subject
Normally, in the PC language, the subject will be at the very beginning of the sentence. This is because there is no a particle to indicate the subject. But now that you can use `so` with a omitted cause, you can use `so` as the subject indicator, so it turn the subject into dynamic position.

- "Ni kome ca ni game, `so` Kacoro sani" -> eat and play, the dogs
 
This is because "so" allow you to indicate the subject without changing the meaning of the sentence.
