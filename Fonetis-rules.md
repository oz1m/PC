## Silabas
All words will be composed by less than 5 silavas where each silava is a consonant followed by a vowel (CV)

Example: 
- Pato (duck): pa-to > 2s
- Foneti (Phonetic): fo-ne-ti > 3s
- Mose (Mouse): Mo-se > 2s
- Kibodo (Keyboard): Ki-bo-do > 3s

### Sipesis kases
#### Start with vowels
Words can optionally start with any vowel, if that's the case, the vowel alone will be the silava.

Example: 
- Alafavete (Alphabet): a-la-fa-ve-te > 5s
- Inose (Introduction): i-no-se > 3s

#### End with consonants
Words also can end with either 'n' or 's' but neither both or other consonant. In that case, the 's' or 'n' will be part of the last silava. 

Example: 
- Patos (Ducks): Pa-tos > 2s
- Sapatos (Shoes): Sa-pa-tos > 3s
- Raton (Rat): Ra-ton > 2s
