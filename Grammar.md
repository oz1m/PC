## Verbs

```EBNF
verb_structure = verb_mood, noun, [verb_tense];
```




### Mood Modifiers

- `ni`: The speaker is affirming an information.
- `ka`: The speaker is asking for information. Do not confuse with the question specifier `ka`, which is placed at the end of sentences.
- `go`: The speaker is giving a command; imperative.


### Tense Modifiers

The action is taking place in:
- `fu`: Future
- `pa`: Past
- `na`: Present continous
- Simple present is represented by the absence of any of the modifiers above.




## Personification

You can't say directly `Mi sa biba` because that literally means `I am life`, and that probably wasn't your intention. That's why we need the personification noun modifier `kano`.

`kano` convert any compound noun or simple noun into a personification of it, for example: 
- `biba kano` -> "The one who live" or "alive"
- `kome kano` -> "The one who eat" or "eater"
- `toki kano` -> "The one who talk" or "speaker"

So, if you want to say "I'm alive", you should say: `Mi sa biba kano`.




## Other
### Booleans

- `si`: Positive, true, yes
- `no`: Negative, false, no
