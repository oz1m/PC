- `pato` (Duck): pa-to, 2 syllables

### Simple Cases
#### Start with vowels

Words can optionally start with any vowel, if that's the case, the vowel alone will be the syllable.

Example: 
- `alafavete` (Alphabet): a-la-fa-ve-te, 5 syllables
- `inose` (Introduction): i-no-se, 3 syllables


#### End with consonants

Words also can end with 's', describing its plural form. Words cannot end with any consonant. In that case, the 's' will be part of the last syllable. 

Example: 
- `patos` (Ducks): pa-tos, 2 syllables
- `sapatos` (Shoes): sa-pa-tos, 3 syllables
- `rato` (Rat): ra-to, 2 syllables
