## Verbs
## Verbs modifiers
The action is taking place in:
- fu: future
- pa: past 
- na: present continous
- if no modifier specified, simple present is assumed


## Personfication
You can't say directly "Ga se biba" because that literally means "I am life", and that probably wasn't your intention. That's why we need the personification noun modifier "kano"

"Kano" convert any compound noun or simple noun into a personification of it, for example: 
- "biba kano" -> "the one who live" or "alive"
- "kome kano" -> "the one who eat" or "eater"
- "toki kano" -> "the one who talk" or "speaker"

So, if you want to say "im alive", you should say: "Ga se biba kano"


## Other
### Booleans
- si: positive, true, yes
- no: negative, false, no
