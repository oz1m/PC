# PC — A Simple and Consistent Constructed Language

**PC** is an open and collaborative conlang (constructed language) designed with one central goal:  
**Keep everything simple, consistent, and logical.**

- No irregularities  
- No hidden complexity  
- A language shaped by clear rules, community discussion, and interactive improvement.

That principle of consistency eases the analysis of the whole language structure programatically, allowing the development of tools like the official [Pisan's Syntactic Analyzer](https://github.com/Ravmnn/Psyan).

## Core Principles

PC is built on a few foundational ideas:

- **Phonetic simplicity:** All words follow predictable CV-based (Consonant, Vowel) syllable structures.
- **Logical grammar:** Rules should be minimal, universal, and easy to apply.
- **Consistency over tradition:** Every feature must follow from a clear internal logic.
- **Community-driven evolution:** Proposals and discussion shape the language.

## Current Rules

The evolving rules of the language are maintained in:

These include:

- Syllable construction
- Allowed consonant/vowel patterns
- Word formation guidelines
- Early grammar and syntax components

As the language develops, these documents will grow with examples, clarifications, and refinements.

## Contributing

PC is intentionally open. You are invited to:

- Propose changes or new rules
- Start discussions about grammar, vocabulary, or structure
- Suggest improvements to clarity or consistency
- Debate design decisions
- Submit tools, scripts, or resources that help the project

**Every idea matters.**  
Whether you are interested in linguistics, conlang design, phonology, or just want to help shape something new, this project is built for collaboration.

## Roadmap

- Expand phonetic and morphological rules
- Define core grammar structures
- Build the base vocabulary
- Develop CLI tools for dictionary management
- Design example sentences and texts
- Translate bigger texts, such as books
- Eventually publish a complete reference guide

## Join the Evolution of PC

PC is more than a conlang — it’s a growing experiment in linguistic design.  
If you enjoy languages, structure, logic, or creation, you’re welcome here.

Bring your ideas. Challenge the rules. Help refine the system.
