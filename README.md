# PC — A Simple and Consistent Constructed Language

**PC** is an open and collaborative conlang (constructed language) designed with one central goal:  
**keep everything simple, consistent, and logical.**

No irregularities.  
No hidden complexity.  
A language shaped by clear rules, community discussion, and iterative improvement.

## 🧠 Core Principles

PC is built on a few foundational ideas:

- **Phonetic simplicity** — All words follow predictable CV-based syllable structures.
- **Logical grammar** — Rules should be minimal, universal, and easy to apply.
- **Consistency over tradition** — Every feature must follow from a clear internal logic.
- **Community-driven evolution** — Proposals and discussion shape the language.

## 📜 Current Rules

The evolving rules of the language are maintained in:

These include:

- Syllable construction
- Allowed consonant/vowel patterns
- Word formation guidelines
- Early grammar and syntax components

As the language develops, these documents will grow with examples, clarifications, and refinements.

## 🤝 Contributing

PC is intentionally open. You are invited to:

- Propose changes or new rules
- Start discussions about grammar, vocabulary, or structure
- Suggest improvements to clarity or consistency
- Debate design decisions
- Submit tools, scripts, or resources that help the project

**Every idea matters.**  
Whether you are interested in linguistics, conlang design, phonology, or just want to help shape something new, this project is built for collaboration.

## 🚀 Roadmap

- Expand phonetic and morphological rules
- Define core grammar structures
- Build the base vocabulary
- Develop CLI tools for dictionary management
- Design example sentences and texts
- Translate bigger texts, such as books
- Eventually publish a complete reference guide
